# civ-1
world generation among other things.

partially inspired by Tarn Adam's `Dwarf Fortress` legends mode.

up to now this "game" has always been quite static, but i plan to implement some kind of (procedural generated) history and (pg) books and so (pg) forth, hope this will come before the relase of Tool's next album.

to run this: simply download and run `meta.py`. there are no viruses, but of course you shall not trust my words: go always safe, guys.

dependencies: `pillow`, any version of it will work i think

FAQ: if you want a bigger world, or more civilizations or less islands 
ecc. simply modify the file meta.py, it should be straightforward.
